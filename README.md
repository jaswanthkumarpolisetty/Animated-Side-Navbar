# Responsive Navbar

This project features a responsive navigation bar built using only HTML and CSS. The navbar includes a sidebar that can be toggled open and closed on small screens using a checkbox hack. This solution avoids the need for JavaScript to handle interactivity.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The navbar adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Sidebar Toggle:** A checkbox-based mechanism is used to toggle the sidebar visibility.
- **Modern Styling:** Utilizes the Poppins font and modern CSS techniques.

## Getting Started

### Files

1. **HTML File (`index.html`):** Contains the structure of the navigation bar.
2. **CSS File (`style.css`):** Contains the styles for the navbar and responsive behavior.

### HTML Structure

The HTML file defines the basic structure of the navigation bar and includes:
- An `input` element of type `checkbox` to control the sidebar state.
- Two `label` elements styled as buttons for opening and closing the sidebar.
- A `div` element with class `links-container` that holds the navigation links.
